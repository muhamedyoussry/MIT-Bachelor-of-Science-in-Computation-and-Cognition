6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python is intended for students with little or no programming experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems and to help students, regardless of their major, feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class uses the Python 3.5 programming language.

&nbsp;

> Topics
- you should graduate form this course knowing how to solve problem and some programming skills and its theoritical concepts
- you will learn what is control flow, how to represent your knowledge with data structure and how to create objects
- you will learn how to organize and modularize systems using object classes and methods
- learn how to know that this program is better than the other program using algorithms

&nbsp;

> What does a computer do ?
- performs calcualtions
- high effecient memory
- computers know only what you tell them

&nbsp;

> Types of Knowledge
- **decalarative knwoledge:** statement of fact
- **imperative knowldge:** is recipe or the "how - to" (steps)

&nbsp;

> Basic Machine Architucture
- Input
- Output
- Memory: Stores data and instructions sequence
- ALU (Arithmetic logic unit): do premetive operations (addition - subtraction)
- Control Unit: Program counter to control the sequence of instructions
 

&nbsp;

> Aspects of languages
- *semanticsis* the meaning associated with a **syntactically correct** string of symbols with **no static semantic errors**

&nbsp;

> Python Objects
- everything in python is object
- objects are
  - **scalar** (cannot be subdivided)
    - *int* ; represents intergs, ex. 5
    - *float* ; represents real numbers, ex. 3.2
    - *bool* ; represetns boolean value True or False
    - *NoneType* ; special and has one value, None
    - You can type casting (convert object of one type to another)
  - **non-scalar** (have internal structure that can be accessed)

&nbsp;

> operators on ints and floats
- i+j : the **sum**
- i-j : the **difference**
- i*j : the **product**
- i/j : **division**
- i%j : the **remainder** when i is divided by j
- i\**j : i to the **power** of j

&nbsp;


> Strings
- letters, special characters, spaces, digits
- enclose in quotation double or single
- we can concatentate strings

``` python
name = "Hana"
new_string = ( " hi " + name )*2 # hi Hana hi Hana

```

> Input/Output
- for printing output use ; print()
- for inserting input from user ; input()

> comparison operators
- the result of comparison operators give you boolean (True or False)
- \>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=


> logic operators
- and, or, not
- you can back to the truth table

> control flow - branching
- if
- if - else
- if - elif - else
-
